#Candy store inventory

This is a short project I wrote for a final in just a few hours.
This project takes input from a .txt file that describes the inventory of
a candy store. It uses that information to give information about that inventory
including the candy types given, in descending order of dollar amount in store.
The total value of all candy, and the total amounts of each type of candy.

#Run instructions
To run just type make in command line, then type ./main <filename>
To run with the sample file given this would be ./main test.txt
